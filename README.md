Assignment: Classwork with Node.js and Express.js <br>
Description: In this classwork, we use Node and Express to build the first version of our recipe web app. <br>
No link for this one, because GitHub pages can only host static HTML pages, like the ones in prior assignments. No server side technology is supported, so Node.js applications won't run on GitHub pages. <br>
